## :wave: About Me

Hi there! I'm Pavel, a creative and enthusiastic frontend developer based in Sweden. I have a passion for creating beautiful and functional web applications that deliver a great user experience. I'm currently studying frontend development at Nackademin AB, where I'm learning the latest tools and techniques to take my skills to the next level.

In my free time, I enjoy working on personal coding projects and experimenting with new design ideas. I'm always up for discussing new projects or collaborations, so don't hesitate to get in touch! You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavel-sarmiento-5483661a3/) for more information about me or to discuss potential opportunities.

## :telescope: Currently Working On <a name="currently-working-on"></a>

I'm currently working on a group project to create a weather web application. In this project, I am responsible for all the SASS, which involves creating stylesheets to enhance the look and feel of the web app.

This project is part of the frontend developer courses I'm taking at Nackademin AB, where I'm learning the latest web development tools and techniques. I'm excited to apply my new skills to this project and create a web app that delivers a great user experience.

You will be able to find the finished version of the weather web application on my [portfolio page](https://palutzii.github.io/) as soon as the project is completed. I look forward to sharing the final product with you!

## :tada: Fun Fact

Did you know that the first website ever created is still online? It was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, in 1991. But here's the really funny part: the website is just a single page with a bunch of links, and it looks like something a high school student might create in a basic web development class.

Check it out for yourself: [The First Website](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html)

Isn't it hilarious to think that the first website ever created is so simple and basic? It just goes to show that even the most amazing inventions often start out as humble beginnings.
