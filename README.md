## üìö About Me

Hello, world! I'm Pavel, a passionate frontend developer hailing from the beautiful country of Sweden. My journey into the world of web development started with a simple curiosity about how websites work, and it quickly blossomed into a full-blown passion. I love the challenge of turning a design into a fully functional website and the creativity that frontend development allows.

Currently, I'm honing my skills at Nackademin AB, where I'm diving deep into the latest frontend technologies and best practices. When I'm not coding or learning something new, you can find me exploring new design ideas or working on personal coding projects.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pavel-sarmiento-5483661a3/) to learn more about my journey or discuss potential collaborations.

## üöÄ Currently Working On <a name="currently-working-on"></a>

I'm currently enrolled in the Frontend Developer program at Nackademin, a highly respected educational institution in Sweden. This intensive two-year program is designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge needed to excel in the field of frontend development.

The curriculum covers a wide range of topics, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, SASS, Node.js, Express.js, and more. It also includes specialized courses such as "JavaScript 4", which deepens understanding of JavaScript frameworks and unit testing, and "Interaction with CMS", which provides an overview of the most important CMS systems a frontend developer typically comes into contact with, focusing particularly on headless CMS systems. These courses, among others, emphasize the importance of understanding and explaining all stages of the development process, from initial design to final deployment.

One of the unique aspects of this program is its focus on practical, hands-on learning. A quarter of the program is dedicated to Learning in Work (LIA), where students get the opportunity to apply their theoretical knowledge in a real-world work environment. This experience not only helps solidify my learning but also provides valuable industry connections and insights.

In addition to the technical skills, the program also emphasizes the importance of good problem-solving and communication skills, as frontend developers often need to collaborate with various stakeholders, including UX designers, backend developers, testers, designers, and product owners.

I'm excited about the opportunities this program offers and look forward to applying my learning to real-world projects. Stay tuned for updates on my projects and learning journey!

## üéâ Fun Fact

Did you know that the first website ever created is still online? It was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, in 1991. You can check it out [here](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html). It's a humble reminder of how far we've come in the world of web development.
